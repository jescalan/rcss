## rcss

I'm writing a css preprocessor for practice. I have a lot of cool ideas for css preprocessor features that I'm going to try to integrate, but this is mainly a challenge for myself - this is the most complex code I have worked on to date. I plan on fully porting this to coffeescript as well. I'm concurrently taking 2 classes on compilers, so hopefully this will help as well.

Someday perhaps I can use any knowledge I gain from this project to contribute to sass and/or stylus.

**Dream Features:** _(starred aren't implemented anywhere else)_
- style agnostic - use brackets and semicolons or not
- nested selectors
- variables
- native-style mixins: mixins look exactly like a normal css prop/val
- introspection
- logic - if/else, arrays, loops, etc.
- keyword arguments
- * @media bubbling and smart combination
- * css dom traversal: can detect and grab prop/vals from parents or anywhere up the tree
- file importing
- executable

I have been programming for about a year, am 100% self taught, and have never built anything like this before. Should be quite a journey!
